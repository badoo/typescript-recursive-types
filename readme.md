# ts-recursive-parser

This module allows you to recursively generate type definitions from a Typescript type or program. It's targeted towards other tools or styleguides which can leverage it to display complex information about their components.

This is in alpha stage right now, we have a proof of concept which works and need to test it on bigger projects internally at MagicLab before exposing it further.

## Todo

* Expose correct APIs
* Document examples

# To test it locally

```bash
npm test
```
